# collections

Ansible collections are a distribution format that can include [playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html#term-Playbooks), [roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html#term-Roles), [modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html#term-Modules), and [plugins](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/plugins.html).  Like [roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html#term-Roles), collections can also be shared via [Ansible Galaxy].
