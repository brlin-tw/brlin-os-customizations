# roles

Define automation that can be reused in multiple [plays](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html#term-Plays) and even shared for others to use on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/).

A role can define [variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html#term-Vars-Variables) with defaults that can be overrided by the consumers to customize its behaviors.
