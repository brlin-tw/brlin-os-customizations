# OS customizations of Buo-ren Lin

This project provides personally preferred operating system customizations, for convenience after re-installing the system.

Via the use of Ansible automation, it should be able to extend it to other OS distributions.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be met in order to use this solution:

Your Ansible controller host must install the following software:

* [Ansible](https://ansible.com)  
  For running deployment Ansible playbooks.
* [`jmespath` PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/jmespath/)  
  For parsing JSON data from responses of the GitHub APIs.
* [sshpass](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sshpass/)  
  For supporting Ansible managed hosts that uses SSH password authentication.

Your Ansible managed nodes to deploy must satisfy the following requirements:

* Currently only Ubuntu 24.04 is supported.
* It must be accessible from the Ansible controller host via the SSH protocol, as an exception you can also use the managed node itself as the Ansible controller host.
* It must have access to the Internet.

## How to use

1. Download the release archive from [the project's Releases page](https://gitlab.com/brlin/brlin-os-customizations/-/releases)
1. Extract the downloaded release archive
1. Launch a text terminal application
1. In the text terminal application, change the working directory to the extracted project folder
1. Run the following commands to execute [the customization playbook](playbooks/apply-customizations.yml) and provide your sudo password on prompt:

    ```bash
    ansible_playbook_opts=(
        # Ask the user's become password
        --ask-become-pass
    )
    ansible-playbook \
        "${ansible_playbook_opts[@]}" \
        playbooks/apply-customizations.yml
    ```

   If you intend to use [the remotehost inventory](inventory/remotehost/main.yml), add the `-i inventory/remotehost` command option and argument to the `ansible_playbook_opts` array definition, note that in this case the system will automatically reboot to apply the changes while running [the customization apply playbook](playbooks/apply-customizations.yml).

1. (If using the localhost inventory) Reboot the system to apply the changes

## Variables to customize the playbooks' behaviors

The following host variables can customize the playbooks' behaviors.

You can specify it by using the `-e` `ansible-playbook` command option or by directly edit the inventory/playbook.

### brlinos_skip_upgrade

Skip the full system upgrade process, this is useful in subsequent deployment, to avoid disrupting the user session.

**Supported values:**

* `true`: Skip upgrade.
* `false`: Don't skip upgrade.

**Default value:** `false`

### brlinos_skip_software_installation

Skip the lengthy preferred software installation process, this is useful if you only want to do the configuration portion of the play.

**Supported values:**

* `true`: Skip software installation.
* `false`: Don't skip software installation.

**Default value:** `false`

### brlinos_apply_flash_storage_workarounds

Whether to apply flash storage drive workarounds to enable TRIM-like support of certain drives on Linux.

As wrongly apply workaround on drives with faulty TRIM-like command translation implementations this may cause data loss, users should evaluate the risk before enabling this option.

**Supported values:**

* `true`: Apply workarounds.
* `false`: Don't apply workarounds.

**Default value:** `false`

## Development

This section documents helpful information in developing this project:

### Detecting configuration file responsible for a specific configuration

Use the inotifywait command from [the inotify-tools package](https://github.com/inotify-tools/inotify-tools/wiki) to detect which file has been modified during a configuration change:

```bash
inotifywait \
    --monitor \
    --event close_write \
    --recursive \
    ~/.config
```

For files in a BTRFS filesystem that are indicated with inode number instead of file path in the `inotifywait` command's output, you can query the real path by running the following command _as root_:

```bash
btrfs inspect-internal inode-resolve _inode_num_ _mountpoint_
```

, where the _mountpoint_ placeholder should be replaced with the BTRFS volume mountpoint that contain the file.

### Detecting GSettings key responsible for a specific configuration

Run the following command to detect which GSettings key has been modified during a configuration change:

```bash
gsettings monitor _schema_
```

You'll need to know the GSettings schema this key belong to before monitoring it, run the following command to determine the correct schema:

```bash
gsettings list-schemas
```

### Detecting dconf key responsible for a specific configuration

Run the following command to detect which dconf key has been modified during a configuration change:

```bash
dconf watch /
```
