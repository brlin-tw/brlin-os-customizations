# The determining-git-commit-messages skill

This skill provides guidelines on how to determine appropriate git commit messages that are compliant with project standards. It should be used when generating, modifying, or reviewing git commit messages.

## Rule of thumb

Always read the previous commit messages of the staged files and mimic the style and format used in those messages.

If there are no previous commit messages for the staged files, refer to previous commit messages in similar files or modules within the same project to maintain consistency.
